IIT Madras Robowars Competition

Project Overview

This repository documents my participation in the prestigious IIT Madras Robowars competition. The competition challenges participants to design, build, and operate combat robots capable of performing in intense battles. My robot was engineered with precision, durability, and power to compete at the highest level.

Key Features of the Robot

Frame and Protection

Main Frame: Constructed using robust metallic plates to provide structural integrity and withstand high-impact collisions.

Border Protection: Enhanced with titanium plates for superior defense against opponents' attacks.

Mobility

Equipped with two 1000 KV motors to drive the wheels, ensuring swift and agile movement across the battle arena.

Offensive Mechanism

Powered by a 400 W geared e-bike motor, the robotâ€™s offense is designed for maximum impact.

Features a drummer weapon, engineered to:

Flip or push weights of up to 27 kilograms with precision and power.

Competition Highlights

Successfully demonstrated the robot's ability to endure intense battles while maintaining operational efficiency.

The combination of mobility, protection, and offensive capability showcased a balanced and competitive design.

Learnings and Future Improvements

Participating in IIT Madras Robowars was an enriching experience, offering insights into advanced robotics, combat strategies, and teamwork.

Future iterations of the robot could focus on weight optimization, enhanced control systems, and improved weaponry for greater effectiveness.
